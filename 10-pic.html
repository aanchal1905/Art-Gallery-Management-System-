    <h1>RAM KUMAR</h1>
    <p>Ram Kumar (23 September 1924[6] â€“ 14 April 2018) was an Indian artist and writer who has been described as one of India's foremost abstract painters.[7] He was associated with the Progressive artist's group along with greats like M.F. Hussain, Tyeb Mehta, S.H. Raza.[8] He is said to be one of the first Indian artists to give up figurativism for abstract art.[9] His art commands high prices in the domestic and international market. His work "The Vagabond" fetched $1.1 million at Christie's, setting another world record for the artist. He is also one of the few Indian Modernist masters accomplished in writing as well as painting.[10]
</P>  <p>Ram Kumar Verma was born in Shimla, the capital of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh in a large middle-class family of eight brothers and sisters.[11] His father was a government employee from Patiala in Punjab, India who worked in the Civil and Administrative Division in the British Government.[12][13] While pursuing M.A. in Economics from St. Stephen's College, Delhi,[14] he chanced upon an art exhibition in 1945.[15] One evening, after "loitering" around Connaught Place with his friends from St Stephen's College, he landed up at an art exhibition.
